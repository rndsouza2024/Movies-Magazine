    "news1":"'All Is Lost' is an action/adventure movie that follows the harrowing journey of an elderly man who faces life-threatening challenges while stranded at sea. The film begins with the man finding his ship taking on water after colliding with a floating container in the Indian Ocean. As his ship's equipment is ruined by water, he manages to dislodge the container and begins repairs. Despite his efforts, he battles continuous setbacks, including a broken bilge pump and damaged radio. A tropical storm hits, further damaging the ship and leaving him with a severe head injury. The man eventually abandons the sinking ship for a liferaft, collecting supplies for survival. \n\n  He tries to navigate towards shipping lanes, hoping for rescue, but encounters more storms and a mental breakdown as his situation worsens. On the ninth day, dehydrated and weak, he writes a farewell message to his family and sets it adrift. Spotting a ship, he lights a fire to signal for help, but the flames consume his raft. As he prepares to die, a searchlight appears, and he is miraculously rescued, ending his ordeal after eight days at sea. ",
