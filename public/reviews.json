    "head1": "Synopsis",
    "news1":"Kota Factory Season 3 has arrived. Summarize this series in a few words because if you have seen the first two seasons, educational path wise, Jeetu Bhaiya's perspective wise, or student's life-related strain wise, this series does not alter in any way. There is a slight change, but the plot is nearly identical in season three. There are five episodes, each lasting approximately 40 to 45 minutes, with the final episode lasting an hour, so keep in mind that if you binge watch, it will easily take four hours, but this series, which examines many important aspects of life, makes those four hours worthwhile. It begins with a recap of the last section, so if you've watched it before, you'll like it. Otherwise, there may be issues with understanding the characters and their arcs. Jeetu Bhaiya is currently suffering from emotional harm as a result of the incident that occurred in the previous part's last episode. The remainder of the people are busy preparing for the JE Mains. Now, pupils are The protagonist is Apna Vaibhav, and the teacher is Apna Jeetu Bhaiya. Now they both want to go forward in their lives; whether they are able to do so or not is the plot of season three; nevertheless, as with the previous part, this part has certain repetitions, such as a student life, a teacher-student band. Children face study pressure, test pressure, health pressure, and family pressure, among other things.  \n\n The pressure of being ahead in the competition is above pressure, so all of these things have been focused very minutely, where everyone has acted so well that how can I praise any one person? I will not praise for a minute the character of brother Vaibhav who has played Mayur More, which is a monologue of his, that too for more than 2 minutes, 2 minutes 15 or 20 seconds. And that monologue, which I am composing and delivering, will go viral on social media, much like Kartik Aryan's terrible one take speech did. What an acting performance by Mayur, more man, this guy is going to go a long way here. During this season, more emphasis was placed on the instructor perspective than the student perspective. There has been so much useful information provided on Self-Respect and Relationship that you will begin to feel compelled to adopt it in your own life. This series is unquestionably fictitious, but it was created by mixing the dreams of countless pupils.   \n\n  You don't just see it; you feel it. Yes, brother, this is me. This is my narrative, and what distinguishes TVF is their ability to reach the hearts of ordinary people and delight them, therefore do not miss this series. From my perspective, this season of Kota Factory deserves four out of five stars. Now let us talk about the trailer; it is not crucial that a trailer has arrived, but it is significant. We'll find out later, but based on how anxiously people waited for it, the video was constructed correctly, with the most correct being the last few seconds of the trailer, where Kaleen Bhaiya's full trailer enters on one side and ends on the other. Pankaj Tripathi's voice returned within the previous 10-15 seconds. \n\n  The same sequences of Liti and her will also be there. Gud Bhaiya is also shown relishing in one scenario and blowing someone up with a gun, so have a look at his gun. Bhai Prime people understand that if individuals show what they have to show, who will win in this game of thrones, and what type of techniques are being used? It's worth seeing if he wins; just add a cameo from Munna Bhai, even if it's an ancient back story, and it'll be entertaining. The rest of the series will be available on Prime Video on July 5th; however, keep an eye on Prime starting July 4th after 8 p.m. Keep it hidden; perhaps you've already seen Kota Factory and Mirzapur; the rest is up to you. Have you watched the trailer? See you in the future video. Bye.",

    "news1":"At this moment the whole world is thinking only about one thing, what is the role of Prabhas in Kalki 2898 AD, is it Kalki herself or Lord Shiva's incarnation Bhairava? Nag Ashwin himself gave the answer and also revealed the biggest hint of the film's story till date. Made such dangerous planning that your senses will be blown away. This is the biggest complaint of the fans about the makers of the film. They are not promoting it at the level it actually deserves, so the team of the film has silenced everyone by putting out a new promotional content. This is a sensible thing. For the sensible audience, a video named Prelude of Kalki has come which Actually it's like an introduction just before we step into Kalki's world and I'm sure. Believe the detailing with which Nag Ashwin is explaining each and every thing, on 27th June, Day One of Indian Cinema, all box office records finished RIP, first of all, watching this video will clear the doubts of those people who are thinking that That tomorrow's Adi Purush 2.2 is not going to be made, there are Boss God level visuals in this short video. \n\n A completely different world has been created, if your eyes tear up just after seeing the sketches, then what will happen in the theatre? Ashwin has started the video by saying that his film is like a sequel to Mahabharata, everyone knows what happened in Mahabharata and what next after that. The story of Kalki is going to start from here, the first scene of the film is probably Mahabharata. There will be a climax of the battle in which Lord Krishna himself can be seen. Yes, let me tell you an inside news, I have come to know that there are going to be not one, two, three but at least 15-20 small but powerful cameos inside Kalki. You should understand one thing very clearly that the character of Ashwathama is appearing again and again in the teaser trailer. The one who impressed everyone the most is only on 1. If we consider the actual film, it is not just Ashwat Dhama in the story. All the characters names you have heard in Mahabharata will be in the film. This is where point number two comes from when Nag Ashwin himself started his film. DC is calling it a competition to Hollywood giants like Marble Star Verse. There is overconfidence and not self-belief. They have confidence in their mythology and sci-fi topic due to which a film about a superhero's father has been made. Look, Nag Ashwin wants to give us in theaters what Ramayana and Mahabharata have been explaining to people for many years.   \n\n  The battle of good versus evil and this is where the biggest secret lies. He revealed this when he told that to end every war, a God incarnates who decides victory or defeat, just as Lord Krishna had defeated the Kauravas by supporting the Pandavas in the Mahabharata, but Kalyug is the same battle. It had already started in Kalki that the battle of Heroes vs Villains would be fierce. As it happens just before ending every era, understand Ramayana Mahabharata and 99 It is confirmed that in this battle, the one who is going to captain the heroes is Prabhas i.e. Bhairava who will be the incarnation of Lord Shiva, here Ashwathama will also be in his team along with others. All Chiranjeevis who have been blessed with immortality are the final battle of Kaliyuga. Kamal Haasan Sir will be the captain of the team of the opposite villain who will take part in it. Whether he is Asur Kali or not is a question of a different level, its answer will probably be found only in the theaters and when the final battle of Heroes vs Villains is going on, then this battle will take place. The 10th and last incarnation of Lord Krishna, Lord Kalki, will enter the Empire. This means bad. The news may be that in the first part of the Kalki film, we may not be told who is actually going to be Kalki.  \n\n  Part one of the project will end there when the whole world will come to know that Kalki has taken incarnation on earth. But his darshan will not happen before part two. Nag Ashwin is clearly telling about the fight. He will start Kalki in 2898 AD, Kalki will be brought into the film only to decide its climax, not before that. Now do not think that Prabhas's character has been wasted, his role is completely useless when he is not from yesterday. So how did he become the hero of this story? Have you read Mahabharata in TV serials? So you must have seen that Lord Krishna only shows the path and by following it, Arjun becomes the biggest hero of this fight. You understand that Prabhas is going to be the Arjun of this Kaliyuga, to show the path, Lord Kalki will be entered in the part two of the film. Actor Who Am I? I don't know at all who used to say this till today, not just Raja Mauli, Prabhas. Just like actors know how to use themselves, Prabhas's career will end without them. The way boss Nag Ashwin has planned to make Prabhas the biggest hero of Kalyug, it can be 10 times bigger than Baahubali. The fight of Baahubali is just Starts from the Kingdom of Mahishmati and ends in Kalki. Prabhas will fight for the whole world, do you understand? Well, one more thing that I have noticed in this video is that till now we are focusing only on the future, how the film will show the story of 500-600 years ahead but the real game of Nag Ashwin is in the past. They will also recreate the old era hidden in which there is a small hint of Amitabh Sir's Ashwathama. The look was that Nag Ashwin has spent 5 years in writing this film, what do you think, not just one part, the story will end within three hours, absolutely not, Kalki 2898 AD is just an introduction to the Kalki Universe, the next chapter of which will be the most important. Because Kalki will be standing there with Prabhas, come and see immediately. That Kalki's new video will make you understand why I am so excited about this film. This prelude video will make many people displeased with Bhairava Anthem. Be ready on 27th June. Dinosaur is coming. You may have liked something in the rest of the video or else. If you have any complaint then wait for me, I will meet you in the next video. take care bye bye",

    "news1":"I told you that Pushpa is not the cinema, but the cinema needs Pushpa the most; otherwise, have you ever seen a film abruptly change its release date with no one clearly stating the opposite when the new release date is announced tomorrow? When it arrived, it appeared like some event was being celebrated throughout the country. The remainder of the reviews would have been necessary. To release the film on festival dates, but when Pushpa arrives, the date is automatically changed to a festival. This year, Christmas and New Year will arrive 20 days sooner since there will be no party celebrations in cinemas on December 6th. Pushpa Bhau has reduced back loading, sir. However, the film's makers grew so enthusiastic after seeing the public that they provided the largest hint from the film so far in the new poster. Believe me when I say that Pushpa Two's narrative is complete. How many people have seen Pushpa One? Quickly raise your hands, although you may not have watched it closely; otherwise, how can you sit so silently after viewing the film's poster? It is such that some time ago, insiders revealed that Pushpa would not be completed in two parts, but rather in a trilogy, and many were thinking that now that the rice was done, Pushpa had also sat on the throne, so what was the need for part three? And this is when you missed the most obvious sign that Pushpa One is truly where This Pushpa Franchiser scene marked the last finale, which will be revealed in Part 3.  \n\n Don't you get it? The red sandalwood that Pushpa Bhaiya smuggled became a don; its eventual destination is not local, but international, and it travels directly to Japan. A scene from a Japanese wedding was also presented. Pushpa Van begins with the gift of a crimson sandalwood guitar. Now look carefully at the wedding, this new release date announcement poster of Pushpa 2 does not appear different, it is not looking a little foreign type, Boss, this poster is the strongest sign of the firm link between Pushpa and Japan, the final of Pushpa 2. This narrative will not conclude in Part One; we introduced a character who was the mastermind of the smuggling network. His face was not revealed at that point in the film. It has now been confirmed that he would portray the evil role Sanjay Dutt in the film's second installment, which will be Pushpa Bhaiya's most difficult assignment yet. Do not be tense. Bhawar Singh is also present in the tale; without him, Pushpa's story would be incomplete. But he is not the franchise's villain. This new billboard definitely implies that Pushpa Bhaiya will create ripples in both the local and worldwide underworlds. In part three, he will confront the franchise's super villain, and you will be startled. Hearing that the role will be portrayed by a major name made me feel... The report is that filmmaker Sukumar is expecting to smash all the box office records as soon as his second picture is out, following which his film would hit number one in Indian cinema. Then he'll go to his favorite actor for Part Three. Isn't that an invitation to become the primary villain, like in the dialogue from the film Godfather? You can't reject; simply realize that the actor who gets this opportunity will not refuse to be the face of Pushpa Tha, and here's the most scary good news: Pushpa Tha might be SR K or Yash in front of Allu Arjun in Japanese Adventure.  \n\n Similarly, actors can be There will be a cameo, but the actual news may be the reverse. Shahrukh Khan's appearance in Pushpa's film demonstrates that he understands that simply conquering Bollywood would not provide results. If you wish to become the true monarch, you must win Pan India in this manner. In Jab Pushpa to become the number one film in Indian cinema, After that, SRK will have a chance in Part 3. Who will reject to undertake the franchising? And, since we're talking about super villains, how can Monster Yash not appear in this game? If this confrontation takes place, theaters will transform into stadiums. Aside from the box office revenue, I'm curious how many hours it takes to book a movie ticket. We will have to wait, the internet will fall down, and those who believe that all of this is a pipe dream, Guru, use logic and see, when Pushpa 2 earns 2000 crores and breaks all records, director Sir Sukumar will create Pushpa 2 even greater. What will Allu Arjun do? Will he make his film multi-starrer? It is certain that Pushpa's narrative will not finish with Part 2, and this poster is the most compelling evidence that Pushpa will visit Japan. The 6th of December may seem far away, but the next teaser for the film will be released in July. Maybe after that, be ready for the trailer Pushpa to the event, which has started now. Simply relax and check inside your head to see who is feeling more hungry about Allu Arjun versus SR K or Allu Arjun vs Yash in Pushpa 3? Leave a comment below. If you appreciated anything in the rest of the video or had any complaints, please let me know.",

    "news1":"Look, a lot of sports drama films have been created in India, including Chakde Gold, 83, Dangal Maidan, Mary Kom, Ghoomar, Sultan, Jhund, and many more, some of which worked and some of which did not. Moving ahead in the same sports drama film genre, the film Chandu Champion, starring has released a biography. Kartik Aryan is in the lead role. The film is a bio biographical sports drama based on the biography of Shri Muralikant Petkar, and it depicts three games he played, first wrestling, then boxing, and finally swimming, as well as a little bit about his real-life struggles and how he overcame them. The plot is well-focused; it begins in Sangli, Maharashtra, and many of the characters are Marathi at first. Many Marathi terms are also utilized, and many of the characters' accents are Marathi, including Pushpa Bhau's. It's a cameo; look now to grasp what I'm saying. According to certain reports, the budget for Chandu Champion is over Rs 140 crores, but do you believe it will be able to collect Rs 6 crores on its release date, June 14th? Do you have an opinion on this? If so, utilize it appropriately and go to Probo to submit it on India's first opinion trading platform. Where the focus in the first half is on the build up and two sports pay and how Murali goes to the army, from there how boxing plays and in the interval block is the one shot action of the army which has actually been made smartly one take because it came two-three times.  \n\n  Notice that there is so much smoke on the screen due to the bomb blast. Nothing is visible in front so it is obvious that transitions have been used there but anyway that scene has been made very well, that Satyanash song in the first half which is just a time pass, it was not really needed, in the second half it was a bit of a problem. Becomes emotional when Muralikant has surgery and suffers again after being shot by bullets. Now it has been demonstrated that the motivating factor is that even after being shot by nine bullets, one should not abandon one's desire to be a sportsman and train for the Paralympics. Hats off to Murali sir for his deadly commitment and the manner Petkar sir's biography has been adapted for the big screen. I believe this is one of Karthik's greatest performances, and some of the phrases are also quite powerful, as if even someone like us were to do miracles, who will the average man pity? The second one had a large chair and a little idea, as well as similar conversations, and all of the side characters are played by side actors, including Rajpal. Yadav Vijay Raj He has done fantastic job, however this movie is two and a half hours long. It might have been quicker paced if some of the speeches were cut and the Satyanash song was removed. I didn't find many problems with the picture. The film's entertainment value is pretty high, and it keeps you interested during sporting events. Rest. Overall, Maidan is a good sports drama picture that we haven't seen in quite some time. It was a good sports drama biographical film, but it was rejected. Now, only the audience knows how Chandu Champion is doing at the box office, but I can guess. Director Kabir Khan has handled this matter brilliantly, and you will undoubtedly see it in the theatre. If you appreciate it, I give it one and a half stars out of five for the family.",
