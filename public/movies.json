    "head1": "Synopsis",
    "news1": "In the third season of UNDEKHI (UNदेखी), director Ashish Shukla masterfully weaves a complex narrative that delves deep into the corruption and brutality of the upper class. The Atwal family's grip on power remains unchallenged, as they crush their enemies with impunity. This bold portrayal of brutal injustice is underscored by a justification matrix that is as undekhi (unseen) as the title suggests. It's almost as if a member of the Atwal family themselves crafted this gripping series. \n\n The season opens with a poignant and ironic scene: a policeman from DCP Ghosh's team is killed under mysterious circumstances. Immediately following this, the Atwal mansion erupts in celebration with traditional Punjabi drums, creating a stark and tragic juxtaposition. This scene sets the tone for the entire season, highlighting the irony and tragedy at the heart of the series.   \n\n Rinku (Surya Sharma) emerges as a central figure, driven by a desire for revenge and a need to restart his illegal drug business. Amidst this chaos, a video of Papaji (Harsh Chhaya) murdering a dancer at a wedding surfaces, becoming the pivotal evidence that reopens the case against the Atwals. DCP Ghosh (Dibyendu Bhattacharya) seizes this opportunity, hoping to bring justice for the dead girl and dismantle the Atwal empire. \n\n  However, the path to justice is fraught with obstacles. Rinku faces the daunting task of protecting his father, Papaji, from the law. Trust becomes a scarce commodity as everyone, including Papaji's son Daman (Ankur Rathi) and daughter-in-law Teji (Aanchal Ji Singh), pursues their own agendas. Daman and Teji seek investors for their resort and dream of escaping abroad, while Teji's friend Saloni (Ann Zoya), the sole surviving witness of the wedding murder, thirsts for revenge. \n\n Director Ashish Shukla introduces new characters, adding layers of complexity to the narrative. Rajeev Malhotra (Varun Badola), aiming to expand his illegal business in Manali, faces new challenges alongside his ruthless manager, Deepika (Shruti Menon). The intertwined fates of these characters make it difficult to keep track of their shifting alliances and betrayals. \n\n Despite the slow pace of the murder investigation, which creates a sense of impending injustice, the stunning natural beauty of Manali provides a striking backdrop to this crime thriller. Harsh Chhaya's portrayal of the crude and alcoholic Papaji is a standout performance, infusing the character with a blend of menace and dark humor. His repetitive yet captivating actions anchor the series, while Surya Sharma's Rinku shows unexpected emotional depth, especially in scenes with his wife Muskaan (Shivangi Singh). \n\n Dibyendu Bhattacharya delivers a strong performance as the relentless DCP Ghosh, supported by the excellent portrayals of Satinder (Rahul Bagga) and Raashi (Lavina Tandon) as part of his investigative team. Varun Badola's portrayal of Rajeev Malhotra adds intrigue to the series, though the roles of Daman and Teji could have been streamlined. \n\n The series effectively captures the viewer's attention with Papaji's mysterious past and the unfolding chaos. The director brilliantly juxtaposes the heinous actions of influential people with moments of dark humor, creating a visceral reaction in the audience. A particularly memorable scene occurs in episode seven, where Rinku, Teji, and DCP Ghosh unite against a common enemy with a heroic background score, blurring the lines between good and evil. \n\n In a climactic moment, ultimate enemies Ghosh and Rinku find themselves out of bullets and forced to work together. This duality reflects the series' core theme: good and evil are two sides of the same coin. The director refrains from passing judgment on the characters, presenting the story as a chilling yet entertaining anecdote. \n\n Season 3 of UNDEKHI (UNदेखी) remains true to its legacy, showcasing the consistent ruthlessness of Harsh Chhaya's Papaji. His performance, marked by physical labor and a deeply uncomfortable posture, is a testament to his dedication to the role. The Atwal family's quest for revenge uncovers buried secrets, deepening the intrigue and danger in Manali. \n\n As with previous seasons, UNDEKHI (UNदेखी) Season 3 explores the bloody games played by its characters to fulfill their selfish desires. The series remains a gripping exploration of power, corruption, and the dark side of human nature, set against the stunning yet treacherous backdrop of Manali.",

    "news1": "Crew 2024 is a riveting thriller about three hard-working women who become entangled in a web of deception, desperation, and peril. Their fates connect as they traverse improbable scenarios, resulting in an explosive story of survival and intrigue. \n\n The narrative starts with a sense of urgency and dissatisfaction. 'Where's the gold?' Where's the gold? Gold? 'Gold? Gold?' is a frantic scream for money and security, which appear to be ever-elusive. The entrance of Vijay Walia, Chairman of Kohinoor Airlines, sets the tone for the battle. He tells the workforce, We want to bring everyone onboard. Hello, My name is Vijay Walia. Chairman of Kohinoor Airlines. When will we receive our salaries? We'll get all of our overdue bills paid next week thanks to the Diwali bonus. But the doubt is palpable: We won't even get a box of sweets for Diwali, and you're dreaming of a bonus. \n\n  Jasmine, one of the major protagonists, is going through her own challenges. 'You haven't paid the rent for six months,' she is reminded. She thinks on her years of hard labor and feels deceived by the system: We worked like maids for 20 years. We allowed them to deduct their taxes. Then the provident fund. We let them screw us over. 'Is our company bankrupt?' Mr. Bindra confirms the terrible truth, asking, 'Madam, what are you saying? Swear to Mother Goddess, Mr. Bindra. We are bankrupt. I swear to God, we're bankrupt.' \n\n  In this time of financial disaster, Rajvanshi sir begs Jasmine to exhibit kindness. But desperation promotes audacity. 'Scoundrel. Will we keep it? Are you out of your mind? 'If we are caught, they will ban us from the airport, let alone an airplane,' she claims. The disclosure of hidden money raises tension: Mr. Mittal, you turned out to be such a sly man. We don't have enough money to purchase cookies, but you're making a fortune. \n\n The trio considers the unfathomable. 'Help us, too, sir. Will you be able to accomplish it? We're going to live it up today like the wealthy.' However, their scheme is dangerously close to failure. 'Where are you going?' To do an unusual dance. I want to see. Comedy? Someone knows about us. The meeting with customs is nerve-racking. 'What are you doing here?' -Customs. Customs? What's inside the bag? Shit.  \n\n  The film depicts the metamorphosis that money may cause. 'Sethi, ma'am.' Money may transform anyone into a gangster. How does he simply get away? 'Because he is rich, baby.' The catastrophic repercussions of inequality are well demonstrated. 'Oh, shit.' Take a look at Titanic. The wealthy escaped on boats. Who had to drown? The department has received some type of tip. You're going nowhere, lady. I'm afraid. Then sing. Which one? 'Gold. 'So much gold.' \n\n  Amidst the pandemonium, Geetu, a competent pilot, is caught in a moral quandary. Geetu. You're a talented pilot who excels at everything. But I can't do it. 'Fly the airplane.' The stakes are high as they await confirmation of the tip: 'Is the tip confirmed?' Solid. 'Does the jail have internet?' \n\n As tensions rise, their destiny hangs in the balance. 'Please take a seat, sir.' They said they were preparing for an arrest. Arrest? You. 'Sit, moron.' Fear, courage, and the unwavering desire of a better life propel the story to its climax.  \n\n Crew 2024 is a compelling narrative of tenacity and the lengths regular people will go when pushed to their limitations. It emphasizes the plight of individuals stuck between economic disparities and the hazardous attraction of quick money. Through comedy, suspense, and raw emotion, the film creates a realistic image of survival in a society where the line between good and wrong is frequently blurred.",

The stakes are sky-high as a nameless, faceless criminal steals the most lethal weapon ever developed in the country, endangering national security and world peace. \n\n  The villain's terrifying pronouncement sends shivers down the spine: 'The most dangerous enemy is the one who does not fear death.' An enemy without a name, identity, or face, whose sole goal is... revenge. With a chilling malice, he taunts, 'Who are you?' Doom. I'm taking something valuable from you all... I hope you do not mind. \n\n  The desperation is evident. The package is the most potent and lethal weapon ever produced in our country. The world has never witnessed a greater battle. You have three days. You must act soon! As terror increases, the only hope is to send two troops who can match the villain's lunacy and fearlessness. 'To catch this psychopath, we'll need two even larger psychos. We possess the heart of a soldier. And the mind of a demon. Beware of us. Because we are India!' \n\n Our heroes, elite troops with opposing personalities, must work together. 'I'll cover the north, you handle the east,' one orders. The other responds, 'Why would you lead?' The tension is great, but the first soldier insists, 'Because I am the best.' Their contrasts are stark: one is seasoned and mature, while the other is youthful and dynamic; one is powerful and a perfectionist, while the other is quick and fierce. Despite their disagreements, they must find a way to work together.  \n\n  Their goal is hampered by their squad, which includes Captain Misha, a seasoned operator, and Pam, an IT Specialist and covert asset. They work together to trace down the stolen cargo, which ends up in an underground vault in London, setting up a worldwide clash. \n\n  However, the mission is beset with internal turmoil. 'Why don't you both follow orders?' their boss asks. One soldier acknowledges, 'My ego is bigger than my talent,' while another mocks, 'His biggest talent is his ego.' However, they must transcend their differences as the villain's menace grows: The entire of India will bear the repercussions for what you did to me. You believe you are really heroes? 'Try to stop me.' \n\n As they face their adversary, the warriors say, 'This battlefield might be yours... But we are the oldest participants in this game. The name of our regiment is Lions. Long live India!' Their commitment is unwavering. 'The more wounded a soldier of this regiment gets… The more dangerous he becomes.' \n\n The climax is a showdown of wits, strength, and endurance. 'We are very old friends...' We may give and steal each other's life. The soldiers' friendship, formed in the embers of previous fights, is their most valuable asset as they face the disguised villain in a lethal encounter. \n\n The action in Bade Miyan Chote Miyan 2024 is unrelenting, the stakes are tremendous, and the characters' friendship highlights the story's heart. It's an action-packed thriller that highlights the bravery, friendship, and unwavering resolve of two soldiers trying to preserve their country.",

    "news1": "Four years after the tragic death of Isabel Aretas, Detective Mike Lowrey finds a new beginning in his life by marrying his physical therapist, Christine. Their wedding, however, takes an unexpected turn when Mike's partner, Detective Marcus Burnett, suffers a mild heart attack during the ceremony. This health scare sends Marcus into a coma, where he experiences a profound vision of their late captain, Conrad Howard. In this vision, Howard reassures Marcus that his time has not yet come, instilling in him a renewed sense of invincibility upon waking. \n\n Once Marcus regains consciousness, he interprets his vision as a sign that he is invincible. Shortly after, a scandal erupts in the media, revealing that Captain Howard was allegedly involved in corruption with drug cartels. Determined to clear their mentor's name and restore his tarnished legacy, Mike and Marcus embark on a mission to uncover the truth. They are joined by Captain Rita Secada and her new boyfriend, mayoral candidate Adam Lockwood, in their quest for justice. \n\n  Their investigation leads them to visit Mike's son, Armando Aretas, who is serving time for Howard's murder. Armando reveals a crucial piece of the puzzle: Howard was never corrupt, but he was on the verge of exposing those who were. The corrupt officials, fearing exposure, hired Armando and his mother to kill Howard. Armando, seeking redemption, offers to help Mike and Marcus identify the true culprits behind Howard's murder. \n\n  As the trio delves deeper into the conspiracy, they discover that the conspirators are attempting to access Howard's computer. However, a fail-safe mechanism triggers a pre-recorded video sent to Mike and Marcus, warning them about widespread corruption within federal and state law enforcement. In this video, Howard uses the code phrase 'Coke bottle,' leading them to their former hacker colleague, Fletcher. At Fletcher's club, they retrieve a QR code hidden in wall art, unlocking a second video from Howard. However, their success is short-lived as assassins track them down and kill Fletcher. \n\n Meanwhile, Armando faces his own peril as he is attacked by fellow inmates posing as prisoners. Displaying his formidable combat skills, he manages to eliminate them all. Mike and Marcus arrange for Armando to be airlifted to a more secure location in Miami, but the conspirators strike again, causing the helicopter to crash. Despite the crash, Mike, Marcus, and Armando survive, only to find themselves branded as fugitives.  \n\n  With a bounty on their heads, the trio is hunted by law enforcement and criminals alike. Amidst this chaos, U.S. Marshal Judy Howard, Conrad's daughter, vows revenge on Armando for her father's death. The tension escalates as AMMO team members Dorn and Kelly assist Mike, Marcus, and Armando in decoding the clues left by Howard. They uncover that a former Army Ranger turned DEA agent, James McGrath, is the mastermind behind the corruption. McGrath, once tortured by the cartel into betraying his associates, has since become a cartel boss himself. \n\n  The stakes reach their zenith when McGrath kidnaps Christine and Callie, Judy's daughter. He also targets Marcus's family, but Reggie, Marcus's Marine son-in-law, successfully defends them. The team exposes Lockwood as McGrath's accomplice and uses him as bait to rescue the hostages at a dilapidated alligator-themed amusement park. \n\n In a climactic showdown, Lockwood meets a grisly end, devoured by an alligator after attempting to double-cross the team. Mike confronts McGrath, who forces him into a deadly choice between Christine and Marcus. Mike, leveraging Marcus's belief in his invincibility, shoots Marcus in his bulletproof vest, creating an opportunity for Christine and Marcus to break free. In the ensuing chaos, Mike kills McGrath. Judy, meanwhile, prepares to kill Armando but is stopped by Callie, who reveals that Armando saved her life. Judy, reluctantly grateful, spares Armando and lets him escape.  \n\n With the corruption exposed and their names cleared, Mike and Marcus celebrate their victory and newfound freedom. The duo, along with Reggie, cooks food on a public grill, basking in the simple joy of a job well done and the bonds of family and friendship.",

    "news1": "Madgaon Express 2024 depicts the humorous and chaotic story of three childhood friends who go on a long-anticipated journey to Goa. Their enthusiasm is apparent as they go on what they hope would be the experience of a lifetime. They had no idea that their voyage is going to take an unexpected turn. \n\n  'I wanna go to Goa,' one of them exclaims. It's our time! If not now, when? 'After college?' The excitement is palpable as they finally decide to take the trip they've been planning for years. At 21 years old, they've never left Bombay, and the prospect of leaving parental tension behind and establishing their maturity makes them ecstatic. We aren't kids anymore! We are grownups. 'Goa, here we come!' they exclaim, ready to have as much fun as they had on their previous trip. \n\n  However, problems arise right away. One of the companions complains, 'This is unsanitary.' I am allergic. Do you want to torment us? Make us sit in a non-air-conditioned compartment? 'If he dies, what will we tell his mother?' 'Another, more positive, responds, 'Why would I die? The Madgaon Express from Mumbai to Goa offers one of the world's most magnificent sights.' The doubtful companion responds, 'You gonna show us scenic views at night?' 'With a torch?' \n\n As night strikes, the train trip grows increasingly weird. In an unexpected twist, they meet a fascinating stranger. 'Are you a prostitute?' one buddy asks, to which the visitor responds angrily, 'What!' No! My buddies are narrow-minded. 'I prefer...'. Chaos erupts as another acquaintance begins slurring, 'My tongue has gone numb.' 'I can't speak properly.' The terror builds when someone yells, 'Cocaine! Cocaine!' followed by a bewildered, 'Totaine?' What? You mean there's a lot of totaine in the bed?  \n\n  The scenario quickly escalates. OPEN UP! Goa Police. 'Where is my stuff?' asks a harsh voice, while another figure moans, This is one awful rifle! The stuff is mine, and I am taking it. The guys become involved in a labyrinth of cops, criminals, and narcotics, completely perplexed. 'What's going on?' one exclaims. Another reassures, Do not be afraid. I am there. I will take care of you. \n\n The tension reaches a climax with a comical mix-up. I adore Goa. You have 10 minutes, Rambo! 'Don't act tough under the influence,' one friend mocks as they confront the thugs. The criminals' leader, Don Mangola, is mistakenly referred to as Don Mandolin, to which he answers angrily, 'Let us go, brother Mandakini.' Incredulous, the companions chuckle, Mandakini? 'Do I resemble the film heroine to you?' \n\n With each twist and turn, their journey becomes a comic nightmare. 'We couldn't ever get to Goa, and now we can't get out,' one buddy laments. In the midst of the turmoil, they even find themselves in an unusual circumstance in which they must 'walk like a woman and push those oranges up.' They keep falling down.  \n\n Madgaon Express 2024 is a chaotic voyage full of fun, uncertainty, and unexpected surprises. It encapsulates the spirit of young adventure and the unexpected unpredictability of life. As the companions negotiate the chaos, they realize that sometimes the trip is more memorable than the goal.",
